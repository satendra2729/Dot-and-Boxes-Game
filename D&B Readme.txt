Based on the code you provided, here is a description of how the web app was built and the environment it's designed for.
🎮 How This Web App Was Built
This "Dots and Boxes" game is a single-file, client-side web application. This means the entire application—structure, styling, and logic—is contained within one HTML file and runs entirely in the user's web browser, requiring no backend server.
* Structure (HTML): The HTML creates the basic skeleton, which consists of three main parts:
   * A "setup screen" (#setup-screen) to choose the number of players and grid size.
   * A "game screen" (#game-screen) that holds the scoreboard, turn indicator, and the game canvas itself.
   * A "game over modal" (#game-over-modal) that appears at the end to show the winner and final scores. The application swaps between these views by adding or removing the hidden CSS class.
* Styling (CSS): The app's visual design is built using two methods:
   * Tailwind CSS: The primary styling is done with the Tailwind CSS framework, which is loaded from an external CDN (Content Delivery Network). This allows for rapid styling using utility classes (e.g., bg-white, rounded-lg, shadow-xl).
   * Custom CSS: A <style> block is used to define custom properties, primarily the player colors (e.g., --p1-color, --p2-color) , and styles for the active player card and the canvas.
* Logic (JavaScript): The entire game's functionality is written in vanilla JavaScript (meaning it uses no external libraries or frameworks like React or Vue).
   * Rendering: The game board (dots, lines, and boxes) is not made of HTML elements. Instead, it is drawn dynamically onto an HTML5 Canvas element (<canvas id="game-canvas">).
   * State Management: The game's state—such as the grid size, player scores , and which lines have been drawn—is stored in JavaScript variables (e.g., hLines, vLines, boxes).
   * Game Loop: The logic is event-driven. It waits for a user to click or touch the canvas.
   * Interaction: The game uses a "click-to-select, click-to-move" mechanic. A user first clicks a dot (which becomes the selectedDot) , and then clicks a valid adjacent dot (isValidMove). This completes the line.
   * Touch Support: The app is explicitly designed to work on mobile devices by listening for touchmove and touchend events and by using CSS to prevent unwanted page scrolling during gameplay.

🖥️ Running Environment & Specifications
* Software: This app is designed to run in any modern web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge) that supports HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6+). It has no other software dependencies.
* Hardware: The application is very lightweight. The game logic (checking for completed boxes) and canvas drawing are computationally simple. It will run smoothly on virtually any modern device, including:
   * Desktop computers
   * Laptops
   * Tablets
   * Smartphones
* Network:
   * Client-Side Only: The game logic is 100% client-side. It does not need an internet connection to play. The game state is managed entirely within the browser and is not sent to or received from a server.
   * First-Time Load: An internet connection is required for the very first time the page is loaded. This is necessary to download the Tailwind CSS file and the Inter web font from their respective CDNs.
   * Offline Use: After these external files have been loaded once, they will likely be stored in the browser's cache. The user can then load and play the game completely offline.
